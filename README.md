# inkyPhat_nightscout
A python script pulling data from nightscout and displaying a graph with your latest glucose on a inkyPhat mounted on a raspberry pi.

I am using a patched version of nightscout where the "delta" field is accessible. It can be found [here](https://github.com/thomaas/python-nightscout) in my forks.
