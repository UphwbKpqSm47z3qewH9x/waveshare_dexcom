# inkyPhat_nightscout
A python script pulling data from nightscout and displaying a graph with your latest glucose on a [inkyPhat](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-phat) mounted on a raspberry pi.

On the inkyPhat it may look like this:
![InkyPhat generated graph](https://github.com/thomaas/inkyPhat_nightscout/blob/main/inkyPhatShown.png "InkyPhat generated graph") 

And like this mounted on to of a raspberrypi:
![InkyPhat generated graph](https://github.com/thomaas/inkyPhat_nightscout/blob/main/inkyPhatShown2.jpeg "InkyPhat generated graph") 

I am using a patched version of nightscout where the "delta" field is accessible. It can be found [here](https://github.com/thomaas/python-nightscout) in my forks.
